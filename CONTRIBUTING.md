# Contributing to the Rust-Buildbot infrastructure

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our infrastructure! The
workflow for this project is similar to, but simpler than, that of the [Rust
language][rust].

## Making Changes

Submit your changes as a pull request to this repository. If there's a
specific contributor who should review the change, mention them with `r?
@theirname` in the body of your commit message. 

The rust-highfive bot will take a look at your PR and make sure you have a
reviewer. 

After all of the reviewer's concerns have been addressed, anyone with
permissions can merge your PR.  

## Testing Changes

If you're an enterprising contributor who'd like to spin up your very own
intsance of rust-buildbot for any reason, we need your help! 

It isn't easy to run your own rust-buildbot for testing changes (or any other
reason) right now, but we're working on it! If you have any specific
complaints about why contributing to this project is hard, please file issues
about them or comment about them on [this issue][issue]!
